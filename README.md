# Vibro-tactile Textile - VTT
### Tactile experience that calm and comfort people. 

## About The project
The VTT project is a therapeutic e-Textile device to entertain and comfort people living with dementia, stress and anxiety.
It uses the multi-touch [eTextile-Synthetizer](https://github.com/eTextile/synth/) technologie with a suitable **audio transducer**, **audio amplifier** and **rechargeable battery pack** to explore a therapeutic application that aim to calm and comfort people living with disabilitys. 

## Components benchmark
We have been evaluating vibrotactile transducers to identify a solution with a good power consumption vs vibrotactile feedback efficiency. Thus to improve the vibrotactile feedback quality by using this type of device instead of traditional DC motors.
Through this evaluation also have selected the most efficient resonator material to amplify and transmit generated low frequencies.

## Selected parts
- [Audio Transducer](./docs/docs/Exciter_bodyshaker_20w_4ohm.jpg) : bodyshaker exciter 20W 4ohm
- [Resonator material](./docs/docs/Nidaplast.jpg) : polypropylene honeycomb plate (Alveolar structure)
- [Audio Amplifier](./docs/docs/25W_subwoofer-amp_mono.jpg) : 25W subwoofer amplifier
- [Battery pack](./docs/docs/18650_lithium_ion_12V.jpg) : 12V lithium-ion (3x18650) charger included

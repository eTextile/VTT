# Vibro-tactile Textile - VTT
### Tactile experience that calm and comfort people. 

## About The project
The VTT project is a therapeutic e-Textile device to entertain and comfort people living with dementia, stress and anxiety.
It uses the multi-touch [eTextile-Synthesizer](https://github.com/eTextile/synth/) technologie with a suitable **audio transducer**, **audio amplifier** and **rechargeable battery pack** to create a Vibro-tactile Textile that aim to calm and comfort users.

## Components benchmark
We have been evaluating vibrotactile transducers to identify the best solution regarding power consumption and vibrotactile feedback efficiency. Thus to improve the vibrotactile feedback quality traditionally made with small DC motors. Through this evaluation we have also selected an efficient resonator material to amplify and transmit generated low frequencies. The battery pack have been chosen for a long autonomy and rechargeable property.
